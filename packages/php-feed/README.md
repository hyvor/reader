## PHP Feed (RSS and Atom) Parser

This library parses RSS, Atom, and JSONFeed feeds into a PHP object called `Feed`. The shape of this object is closely aligned with the [JSONFeed 1.1 spec](https://jsonfeed.org/version/1.1). Additional properties in RSS and Atom feeds are ignored. These formats/versions are supported:

- RSS 0.9
- RSS 1.0
- RSS 2.0
- Atom 1.0
- JSONFeed 1.1
