	<Faq title="What is RSS?">
		If this is your first time hearing about RSS, your whole internet experience is about to change! RSS is an amazing but heavily underutilized technology that allows you to subscribe to websites. It's like subscribing to a Youtube channel, but for websites, with much more control! See our <Link href="/learn">Learn RSS</Link> guide to learn more. You don't need to be a techy to use RSS.
	</Faq>

	<Faq title="Is Hyvor Reader really free?">
		Yes, Hyvor Reader is a completely free & open-source RSS reader. And, no, you are not the product. We do not track you or show you ads. It is merely a product created by the HYVOR team out of love for the open web.
	</Faq>

	<Faq title="How does it work?">
		It's so simple - just subscribe to RSS/Atom feeds in the app and read. No magic. No advanced algorithms. No AI. Just you and the content you love.
	</Faq>

	<Faq title="Do you have Android/iOS apps?">
		No, we are only focusing on the web app for now.
